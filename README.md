# pygenetic: An Efficient Generic, User-friendly Python Genetic Algorithm API
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dannyi96/pygenetic.svg?token=A3bcYHcDEvK23esetBsC&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dannyi96/pygenetic) [![MIT Licence](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/mit/mit.svg?v=103)](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)  [![docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pygenetic/badge/?version=latest)](https://pygenetic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

pygenetic is a Python Genetic Algorithm API which is User-Friendly as well as Generic in nature unlike most GA APIs which make a trade off between the two.

## Motivation
![alt text](https://github.com/dannyi96/pygenetic/blob/master/reports/imgs/motivation.png)
While some APIs like `DEAP` and many more recent ones which are very efficient and generic are less user friendly in nature, other APIs like `genetics` and other smaller ones which are the best in terms of user friendliness are less generic and less efficient. This API intends to strike a balance - good in terms of user friendliness, efficiency and genericity.

## Features
* Presence of both High-Level(`SimpleGA`) and Low-Level API(`GAEngine`) which users can use as per need.
* Very generic API - Users can customize different part of the GA be it Evolution, Statistics, Different handlers, Chromosome Representations.
* Supports efficient evolution execution using Apache Spark. This is highly scalable as more workers can be deployed. Parallelization of fitness evaluation, selection, crossovers and mutations are taken care of.
* Supports Adaptive Mutation Rates based on how diverse the population is.
* Supports Hall of Fame(best ever chromosome) Injection so that the best chromosome isn't lost in later generations due to the selection method used.
* Supports Efficient Iteration Halt 
* Supports Visualization of Statistics like max, min, avg, diversity of fitnesses, mutation rates. Users can also define custom statistics
* Supports usage of multiple crossovers and mutations in one GA execution to enhance diversity
* Supports Population Control(control the population size or allow it grow/shrink) which users can make use of in various research purposes
* Provides a bunch of Standard Selection, Crossovers, Mutations and Fitness Functions
* Provides continue evolve feature so users can continue from previous evolutions instead of starting all over again.
* Provides ANN Best Topology finder using GA functionality

## Installation

pygenetic is published on pypi(https://pypi.org/project/pygenetic/) and can be easily installed by:

```sh
$ pip3 install pygenetic
```

For using pyspark functionality, install `pyspark` , Apache Spark, Scala and JVM.
For using the ANN Topology Finder, install `tensorflow` and `keras` 

## Tests

The various tests are present in the `tests/` directory. The main API tests can tested by:

```sh
$ pytest tests/modules
```

## Usage

### High Level API Basic Usage

```
from pygenetic import SimpleGA
ga = SimpleGA.SimpleGA(minValue=1,maxValue=120,
                      noOfGenes=20,fitness_func=lambda x:sum(x),
                      duplicates=False,population_size=1000,
                      fitness_type='max')
ga.evolve(100)
print(ga.best_fitness)
``` 

### Low Level API Basic Usage

```
from pygenetic import ChromosomeFactory, GAEngine, Utils
factory = ChromosomeFactory.ChromosomeRangeFactory(
			noOfGenes=8,minValue=1,maxValue=8)
ga = GAEngine.GAEngine(factory,population_size=100,fitness_type=('equal',8)
						,mut_prob = 0.3)
ga.addCrossoverHandler(Utils.CrossoverHandlers.distinct)
ga.addMutationHandler(Utils.MutationHandlers.swap)
ga.setSelectionHandler(Utils.SelectionHandlers.best)
ga.setFitnessHandler(Utils.Fitness.addition)
ga.evolve(10)
print(ga.best_fitness)
```

### For more advanced usages and tutorials

 Our python package is extensively documented on [ReadTheDocs](https://pygenetic.readthedocs.io/en/latest). Also, refer [this](https://github.com/dannyi96/pygenetic/blob/master/examples/tutorial.md) for step by step tutorials.

 Refer `examples` for examples of solving different GAs using pygenetic

## GA Online Execution
 Install python `flask` and run
 ```sh
$ python3 flask/views.py
```
Input all the various fields needed for the GA. You can run the GA online and get the best 5 chromosomes of each generations followed by statistics. You can also download the equivalent pygenetic code based on all user inputs in the form
